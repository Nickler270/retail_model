### Model Overview

This dashboard runs a Python-based computational model for data-driven resource allocation in retail. The model combines **forecasting**, **optimization**, and **simulation** to support planning for inventory and staffing.

---

### Components

- **Forecasting**: Predicts product demand using **exponential smoothing**.

st.image("eqtns/exp_mth.png", caption="Exponential Smoothing")
st.markdown("""
- **Optimization**: Uses **linear programming (LP)** to allocate resources efficiently under constraints. 
""")
st.image("eqtns/lp.png", caption="Linear Programming")
st.markdown("""
- **Simulation**: Models store operations over time to evaluate the impact of demand and resource decisions.

---

### Process Flow

1. Load historical sales and resource data  
2. Forecast demand  
3. Allocate stock/staff using LP  
4. Simulate operations  
5. View outputs in plots and metrics

This approach enhances decision-making by improving accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in resource planning.

                ### Forecasting Conclusion & Business Implications

                The chart above shows forecasted demand and simulated sales trends over a 30-day period for selected retail products. Demand patterns were generated using historical-style synthetic data, allowing us to evaluate planning strategies even without real-world inputs.

                #### Key Observations:
                - Products with **high and volatile demand** (e.g., fresh goods or daily essentials) require **frequent restocking** and potentially **shorter replenishment cycles** to prevent stockouts.  
                *Action:* Consider dynamic ordering and keeping buffer inventory to handle variability.

                - Products with **moderate and steady demand** benefit from **scheduled procurement** and tighter inventory control.  
                *Action:* Forecasts can be used to reduce excess holding without risking availability.

                - Products showing **low, consistent sales** are ideal for **minimal stock strategies**.  
                *Action:* Biweekly or monthly restocking may suffice, reducing storage and spoilage risk.

                #### Operational Insight:
                This forecasting model enables:
                - Better alignment between **supply and demand**.
                - Reduction in **waste and stockouts**.
                - More efficient **use of storage space and budget**.
                - **Adaptable planning** even when working with incomplete or generated datasets.

                By integrating forecasting and optimization, retail managers can make smarter, data-informed resource decisions that scale across changing sales patterns and unpredictable demand.
